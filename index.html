            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Beth Graczyk and I’m an artist and scientist based in Brooklyn, NY. I’ve had the pleasure of working in both the arts & sciences for 20-years now, and 2 years ago created a non-profit Beth Graczyk Productions, Inc. based in NYC. My company aims to create intersections in arts and science through contemporary dance-based projects celebrating LGBTQIA+ and neurodiverse communities. 
                I’m currently enrolled in the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN: Women’s Cohort. 
                One of my projects for my company involves developing a web-based application to engage audiences and participants in the neuroscience of visual perception. Learning more about how coding works from both back-end to front-end I’m hoping will help merge ambitions and dreams of application design with realistic tools of understanding how the mechanics work. I work with coders, but I’d like to have a greater understanding to have more effective communication around design needs.  
                Key to being an effective scientist and choreographer is the ability to fluidly move between macro to micro, and it feels like it applies as well to coding. Learning coding makes me feel more connected and empowered to utilize technology in my work, as well as deepen conversations with technologists and those I collaborate with.
